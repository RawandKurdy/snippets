# divNumber
Given three integers k, l and r return the number of integers between l and r inclusive that have exactly k divisors.

It is guaranteed that l ≤ r.<br>

### Example

For k = 3, l = 2, and r = 49, the output should be
divNumber(k, l, r) = 4.<br>

We have 4 integers in that range that have exactly 3 divisors - 4, 9, 25, 49.<br>
