# Amend The Sentence
You have been given a string s, which is supposed to be a sentence. However, someone forgot to put spaces between the different words, and for some reason they capitalized the first letter of every word. Return the sentence after making the following amendments:</br>

Put a single space between the words.</br>
Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.</br>
### Example

For s = "CodesignalIsAwesome", the output should be</br>
amendTheSentence(s) = "codesignal is awesome";</br>
For s = "Hello", the output should be</br>
amendTheSentence(s) = "hello".</br>
