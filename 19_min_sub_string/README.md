# Min Substring With All Chars
You have two strings, s and t. The string t contains only unique elements. Find and return the minimum consecutive substring of s that contains all of the elements from t.<br>

It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are several answers, return the one which starts from the smallest index.<br>

### Example

For s = "adobecodebanc" and t = "abc", the output should be<br>
minSubstringWithAllChars(s, t) = "banc".<br>

### Solution is based on WAXTAP's Idea
