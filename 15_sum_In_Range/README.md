# Sum In Range
You have an array of integers nums and an array queries, where queries[i] is a pair of indices (0-based). Find the sum of the elements in nums from the indices at queries[i][0] to queries[i][1] (inclusive) for each query, then add all of the sums for all the queries together. Return that number modulo 10**9 + 7.</br>

### Example

For nums = [3, 0, -2, 6, -3, 2]</br> and queries = [[0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]],</br> the output should be
sumInRange(nums, queries) = 10.</br>

The array of results for queries is [1, 3, 6], so the answer is 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.</br>
