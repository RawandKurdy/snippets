# First Not Repeating Character
Note: Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.</br>

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.</br>

### Example</br>

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.</br>

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.</br>

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'.</br>

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.</br>
