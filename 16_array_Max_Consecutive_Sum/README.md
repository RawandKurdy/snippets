# array Max Consecutive Sum
Given an array of integers, find the maximum possible sum you can get from one of its contiguous subarrays. The subarray from which this sum comes must contain at least 1 element. </br>

### Example

For inputArray = [-2, 2, 5, -11, 6], the output should be</br>
arrayMaxConsecutiveSum2(inputArray) = 7.</br>

The contiguous subarray that gives the maximum possible sum is [2, 5], with a sum of 7.</br>
